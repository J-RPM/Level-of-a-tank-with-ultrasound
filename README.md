# Level-of-a-tank-with-ultrasound
Construction of a liquid level meter for a tank, using ultrasound. In a symmetrical tank, dividing its maximum capacity in liters by the height in centimeters, we will obtain the number of liters that each centimeter of liquid inside the tank contains. Knowing the maximum capacity of the tank, it is possible to measure the free distance from the top of the tank by reflecting the ultrasound on the surface of the liquid. Then we subtract that distance from the total height of the tank, and thus we can calculate the liters that it stores inside.
